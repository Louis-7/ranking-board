# Ranking Board

Ranking Board is an innovative project that utilizes free resources to build a website for recording people's effort. This repository serves as the dashboard of the Ranking Board. The back-end, which is a Github bot, is called [Ranking Board Helper](https://github.com/Louis-7/ranking-board-helper).

You may be curious about where the database is located. I use a JSON file, located at `data/ranking.json`, to store all the data. I utilize JavaScript code to convert it into the necessary data model.

## Usage

Basically, all you need to do is send a message to the Ranking Board Helper in the following format: "@ranking-helper, give [someone's name] [number_of_points] points for [reason]." For example: "@ranking-helper, give @Louis-7 1 point for innovation."

> There are only 2 types of reasons: innovation and thanks.

After you add the comment, a commit will be pushed to this repository to update the `ranking.json` file. HOWEVER, YOU WON'T SEE THE RESULT REFLECTED ON THE DASHBOARD!! The [Ranking Board](https://louis-7.github.io/ranking-board/) is deployed on Github Pages, and you can access it anytime. However, the Ranking Board Helper is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) with a free t account, so it cannot stay awake all the time! But you can fork [Ranking Board](https://github.com/Louis-7/ranking-board) and [Ranking Board Helper](https://github.com/Louis-7/ranking-board-helper) and host them yourself.
